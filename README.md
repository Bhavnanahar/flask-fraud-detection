Machine Learning Libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
Model: Classification algorithms (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forests)
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (if applicable)
‚öôÔ∏è How to Use
Input Transaction Details: Provide the necessary details about the transaction, such as:
Merchant Name: Name of the business or vendor.
Category: The type of product or service (e.g., Electronics, Clothing).
